# Cub3D Documentation

Cub3D is a project in the curriculum of the 42 coding school that involves creating a first-person 3D maze game using raycasting techniques. The objective is to build a program that generates a 3D representation of a maze and allows the player to navigate through it. The project is inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D and requires the use of the MiniLibX library for graphics rendering.

## Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Solid CPU

## Running the Project

To run the Cub3D project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Cub3D repository.
2. Build the project by running the `make bonus` command.
3. Execute the program by running the `./cub3D_bonus map_bonus.cub` command.

*Make sure to provide the map.cub file as an argument when running the ./cub3D command. This file should contain the necessary information to generate the maze and configure the game.*

## Controls

The controls for playing Cub3D are as follows:

- Movement: Use the keys **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** to move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
- Rotation: Use the left and right arrow keys (**←** and **→**) to rotate the view.
- Mouse Rotation: Alternatively, you can rotate the view by moving the mouse.
- Speed boost: Press  **SHIFT** to activate a speed boost and move faster.
- Interaction: Use **SPACE** to open doors.
- Exit: Press **ESC** or click the red cross to exit the game.

## Mandatory Part

The mandatory part of the Cub3D project includes the following features:

- Wall textures: The maze walls are rendered with textures.
- Sprite: A sprite is displayed within the maze.
- Limited controls: Only the keys **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** are available for movement, and the left and right arrow keys for rotation.

## Bonus Part

In addition to the mandatory part, the Cub3D project offers bonus opportunities. The bonus part adds extra features and functionality to enhance the game. These may include:

- Wall collisions: Implement collision detection with walls to prevent the player from passing through them.
- Minimap system: Create a minimap display that provides an overview of the maze layout and the player's position.
- Doors: Implement doors that can open and close, adding an interactive element to the game.
- Animated sprite: Add animations to the sprite, such as walking or attacking animations, to bring it to life.
- Rotate the point of view with the mouse: Enable the player to rotate the view using mouse movements, providing a more immersive experience.
